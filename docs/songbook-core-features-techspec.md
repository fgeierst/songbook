# Songbook Core Features - Technical Specification

## MVP Approach

This specification breaks down the songbook application into small, user-testable features that can be implemented and deployed incrementally. Each feature provides immediate value to users and can be tested independently.

### Core Design Principles
- **Agile MVP**: Each feature is a complete, user-testable improvement
- **Basic CRUD First**: Start with simple database operations, no complex optimizations
- **Mobile-First**: Optimize for mobile and tablet performance
- **Vanilla CSS**: No CSS frameworks, use standard CSS for all styling
- **RedwoodSDK Conventions**: Leverage framework patterns for consistency

## MVP Feature Breakdown

This technical specification is organized by user-facing features in order of implementation priority:

### Phase 1: Core CRUD Features (Essential MVP)
1. **[Add Song Feature](./add-song-feature.md)**: User can add new songs to their collection
2. **[View Songs List Feature](./view-songs-list-feature.md)**: User can see and navigate their song collection
3. **[View Single Song Feature](./view-single-song-feature.md)**: User can read individual songs with proper formatting
4. **[Edit Song Feature](./edit-song-feature.md)**: User can modify existing songs

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience
5. **[Search Songs Feature](./search-songs-feature.md)**: User can quickly find songs by title, artist, or album

### Phase 3: Sharing Features (Future)
- Share songs with other users
- Public URL sharing
- Share management

### Implementation Strategy
Each feature specification includes:
- **User Story**: Clear user benefit
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable requirements
- **Database Requirements**: Minimal schema changes
- **Server Functions**: Simple CRUD operations
- **UI Implementation**: Complete component with vanilla CSS
- **Testing Checklist**: Manual testing scenarios
- **Definition of Done**: Clear completion criteria

### Technical Approach
- **Basic CRUD**: No caching, optimistic updates, or complex optimizations initially
- **Server-side Rendering**: Use RedwoodSDK's built-in SSR capabilities
- **Simple State Management**: Component-level state, no global state management
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each feature builds on the previous ones

Start with Phase 1 features in order. Each can be developed, tested, and deployed independently before moving to the next.
