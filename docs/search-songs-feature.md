# Search Songs Feature

## User Story
As a user, I want to search through my songs so that I can quickly find specific songs during performances.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search box is visible at the top of songs list
- [ ] Can search by song title, artist, or album
- [ ] Search results update as user types
- [ ] Search is case-insensitive
- [ ] Clear/reset search functionality
- [ ] Shows "No results" when no songs match
- [ ] Search works well on mobile keyboards

## Database Requirements
Uses existing Song model. No database changes needed - search will be client-side filtering for simplicity.

## Server Function Design
No new server functions needed. Uses existing getSongs() to load all songs, then filters client-side.

**Rationale for Client-Side Search**:
- Simpler implementation for MVP
- No additional server endpoints needed
- Immediate search feedback (no network latency)
- Works with existing song loading infrastructure

## UI Implementation

### Route Configuration
- **URL Pattern**: `/songs` (extends existing songs list page)
- **Component Name**: Modify existing SongsListPage component
- **No New Routes**: Search is integrated into existing list view

### Search Box Design
**Layout Integration**:
- Position: Below page header, above song list
- Sticky positioning: Stays visible while scrolling
- Full-width design optimized for mobile use
- Clear visual separation from header and list

**Input Design**:
- Placeholder text: "Search songs, artists, albums..."
- Search icon: Optional magnifying glass icon
- Clear button: X button when text is entered
- Mobile-optimized: Large touch targets, appropriate keyboard type

### Search Functionality
**Search Scope**:
- Song title: Primary search field
- Artist name: Secondary search field
- Album name: Secondary search field
- Case-insensitive matching across all fields

**Search Behavior**:
- Real-time filtering: Results update as user types
- No debouncing: Immediate feedback for simple client-side filtering
- Partial matching: Find songs containing search terms
- Multiple word support: Search for multiple terms in any order

**Search Algorithm**:
- Convert search query to lowercase
- Convert all song fields to lowercase for comparison
- Use string includes() method for simple substring matching
- Return songs that match in title, artist, or album fields

### Styling Requirements
**Search Container**:
- Background color distinct from list items
- Proper padding and margins
- Border or shadow to separate from content
- Responsive design for mobile and tablet

**Search Input**:
- Large, touch-friendly input field
- Clear focus states with proper contrast
- Rounded corners consistent with app design
- Loading states if needed for large collections

**Clear Button**:
- Positioned inside input field on the right
- Circular button with X icon
- Touch-friendly size (minimum 44px)
- Hidden when input is empty

### Component Behavior
**State Management**:
- Track search query string
- Track filtered songs array
- Maintain original songs array for reset
- No complex state management needed

**Search Logic**:
- Filter songs array based on current search query
- Return all songs when search query is empty
- Update filtered results immediately on query change
- Preserve original song order within filtered results

**Clear Functionality**:
- Clear search input when clear button is pressed
- Reset filtered results to show all songs
- Return focus to search input after clearing

### Search Results Display
**Result Presentation**:
- Use same song list item design
- Maintain consistent spacing and styling
- Show filtered songs in original order (newest first)
- No special highlighting of search terms initially

**Result States**:
- All songs: Show complete list when no search query
- Filtered results: Show matching songs only
- No results: Show message when no songs match
- Empty list: Show empty state when user has no songs

**Result Count Information**:
- Optional: Show "X songs found" when searching
- Clear indication when no results found
- Maintain context of total songs available

### No Results State
**Content**:
- Clear message: "No songs match your search"
- Suggestion: "Try a different search term"
- Option to clear search and show all songs
- Maintain search input for easy modification

**Layout**:
- Center-aligned content in list area
- Consistent spacing with other empty states
- Clear call-to-action to modify search

### Mobile Optimizations
**Touch Interactions**:
- Large touch targets for all interactive elements
- Proper spacing between search and list items
- Smooth scrolling with sticky search box

**Keyboard Behavior**:
- Appropriate input type for search
- Submit behavior (optional): Enter key can trigger search
- Clear focus handling when interacting with list

**Performance**:
- Efficient filtering for reasonable song collections
- Smooth real-time updates without lag
- Memory-efficient string operations

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Scenarios
**Basic Search Functionality**:
- Search for exact song title
- Search for partial song title
- Search for artist name
- Search for album name
- Search with mixed case (uppercase/lowercase)

**Search Interaction**:
- Clear search using clear button
- Type and clear multiple search queries
- Search for non-existent content
- Search with special characters
- Search with very long queries

**Mobile Testing**:

- Songs with search term in album are found
- Partial word matches work correctly
- Case insensitive matching works

**Edge Cases**:
- Search with only spaces or empty string
